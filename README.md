# MiniRedis

MiniRedis is a mini version of Redis, a key value store. It features two binaries, a server and a client. The server binary starts up a server that accepts GET, SET, and DEL operations. The client binary starts up a client that read operation commands from the user through the terminal, sends it to the server, and prints out the result.

## TODO
